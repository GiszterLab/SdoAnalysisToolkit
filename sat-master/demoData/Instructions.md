The example datasets used here are a subset of the total data used for SDO analysis within the paper, but nonetheless produce SDOs which are similar to the entire dataset. A reduced subset of the data is used to save on space. 

The entire dataset used in the paper can be found at https://github.com/GiszterLab/SdoAnalysisToolkit_DemoData 
Follow the instructions within that repository for installation. The data structures produced by that repository, 'ppData.mat' and 'xtData.mat' may be placed here for convenience. 

Note that 'example_xtData.mat' and 'example_ppData.mat' contain Trial Number 14-16, while 'xtData.mat' and 'ppData.mat' will be composed of trials 1-22.
